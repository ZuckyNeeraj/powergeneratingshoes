# POWER GENERATING SHOES
Project on power generating shoes

# Concept Behind The Project:
Piezoelectricity was present ever since mid-18th century. Piezoelectricity is 
the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as crystals, certain ceramics in response to applied mechanical stress. 

# Any Practical Uses?
As funny as it sounds, charging a phone with your shoe isn't really joke. Who knows maybe someday shoe companies like Nike could use these insole generators to power fitness chips (inside shoes) that would sync to your phone wirelessly. 
This way, you don't have to charge your smart-shoes just to sync them with your phone.
