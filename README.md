# POWER GENERATING SHOES
Project on power generating shoes

# Idea
It is innovative and eco friendly task. This method is generating electric voltage for charging an inside shoes battery from the piezo element. The pieo electric effect based to piezo element producing a voltage for charging internal battery .the battery charging every running and walking time.then the battery power transfer way is space. That is 2cm to 25cm range.no need data cable and conducting wire.a wireless transmitter and receiver used to electronic gadget charging It is hectic task to use to use every where the shoe of mobile phone or any electronic gadget while travelling or it is very crucial when your mobile phone getting off by the time you urgently need it. Its major problem in today electronic gadget. Then this project is very help full in every day life and further life. 

# Concept Behind The Project:
Piezoelectricity was present ever since mid-18th century. Piezoelectricity is 
the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as crystals, certain ceramics in response to applied mechanical stress. 

# Any Practical Uses?
As funny as it sounds, charging a phone with your shoe isn't really joke. Who knows maybe someday shoe companies like Nike could use these insole generators to power fitness chips (inside shoes) that would sync to your phone wirelessly. 
This way, you don't have to charge your smart-shoes just to sync them with your phone.

# Components of model

# 1. Piezoelectric material
A piezoelectric crystal is placed between two metal plates. At this point the material is in perfect balance and does not conduct an electric current. Mechanical pressure is then applied to the material by the metal plates, which forces the electric charges within the crystal out of balance.

# 2.Rectifier
A rectifier is a device that converts an oscillating two-directional alternating current (AC) into a single-directional direct current (DC). Rectifiers can take a wide variety of physical forms, from vacuum tube diodes and crystal radio receivers to modern silicon-based designs.

# 3.Capacitor
A capacitor is a device that is used to store charges in an electrical circuit. A capacitor works on the principle that the capacitance of a conductor increases appreciably when an earthed conductor is brought near it. Hence, a capacitor has two plates separated by a distance having equal and opposite charges.

# 4. LED
LEDs work on the principle of Electroluminescence. On passing a current through the diode, minority charge carriers and majority charge carriers recombine at the junction. On recombination, energy is released in the form of photons.
